# A notmal ELF automatically calls __libc_start_main, which calls the main function, whicg runs the program

###
# __libc_start_main is the entry point to the program.
## you can find the entry_point address in the ELF header using the 'readelf' tool
# Example:
#  'readelf -h program_name'
## You can verify thisnaddress by disassembling the program and finding the entry point address using the 'objump' tool
# Example: 
# 'objdump -d program name' (the entry point address shouuld be at the '<start>' section of the disassembled program)
# within the <start> section, you will see a few lines of 'setup' and then a "__libc_start_main" symbol. This is where the 'main()' function starts.
###

# NOTE:
# __libc_start_main can be preloaded into the process (using LD_PRELOAD) like any other library
