# Processes can be called and ran recursively

# if you have a script called 'script1.sh' and the contents of that script are
# "#!/bin/echo", then calling './script1.sh' will return the string "./script1.sh"
# because 'script1.sh' calls execve to '/bin/echo' which is called with the command './script1.sh' which echoes that exact string.

# If you the make a script called 'script2.sh' and the contents are '#!./script1', 
# then 'script2.sh' calls 'script1.sh' which call 'echo' which calls execve to echo which returns './script1 ./script2'
