# Syscalls are a way for a process to call INTO the os. 
# The os canNOT call into a process

# SIGNALS are how the os gets a process' attention.
# Signal PAUSE process execution and invoke a "signal handler"
# Signal handlers are functions that take in one argument: The signal number

# Without a handler for a signal, the default action is used... Often, this action is to 'KILL' the process

# NOTE:
# SIGKILL (signal 9) and SIGSTOP (signal 19) canNOT be handled (these need to be sent mnanually)
