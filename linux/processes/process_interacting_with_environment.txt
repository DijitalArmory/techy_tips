# All programs must intercat with the 'outside' world (external to this process)
# This is primarily done via system calls. 
# - Each system call is well-documented in section two of the man pages (man 2 <syscall)
# The 'strace' tool is used to tracesystem calls


# - man syscall <-- gives detailed overview
# - man 2 <syscall name> <-- gives detailed descriptions of individual syscalls

# NOTE:
# you can trigger syscalls with the 'syscall' function
# Example:
# a conventional syscall function --> read(fd, buf, 1024);
# syscall function --> syscall(0, buf, 104) 	<-- same as read()


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Another way of interacting w/the 'outside world' is by sharing memory with other processes.
# This requires system calls to establish, but once establish, system calls are not required
# Easy way -- use a shared memory-mapped file in /dev/shm
