### Where Do Processes Come From? ###

# By "Mitosis"

# fork (and more recently, clone) are system calls that create a nearly exact copy of the calling process; a parent or a child
# The child process later uses the 'execve' system call to replace itself w/another process

## EXAMPLE ##
# - you type '/bin/cat' in bash
# - bash then 'forks' intselk into the old parent process and the child process 
# the child process 'execve's /in/cat, becoming the /bin/cat process
