# The binary's import symbols have to be resolved using the libraries' export symbols
# This is all done when the binary is loaded
# NOTE:
# you can view a list of the symbols imported from an object file using the 'nm' tool
# Example:
# 'nm -D <program>'	(the -d = 'dynamic' meaning imported into the file)
