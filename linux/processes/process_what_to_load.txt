### What To Load? ###

# To figure out what to load, the kernel reads the beggining of a file (i.e. /bin/cat) and makes a decision...

# If the file starts with #!, the kernel extracts the interpreter from the rest of that line and executes this interpreter with the original file as it's argument.

# If the file matches a format in /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc, the kernel executes the interpreter specified for that format with the original file as the argument. 

# If the file is a dynamically linked ELF, the kernel reads the interpreter/loader defined in the ELF, loads the interpreter and the original file, and lets the interpreter take control. 

# If the file is a statically linked ELF, the kernel will load it. 

# Other legacy file formats are checked for. 

# -- These can be recursive --
