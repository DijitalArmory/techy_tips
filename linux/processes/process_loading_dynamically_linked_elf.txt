### Loading Dynamically Linked ELFs ###

## The interpreter LOCATES the libraries
# 1. The program and its interpreter are loaded by the kernel
# 2. The interpreter locates the libraries
# - LD_PRELOAD env variable and anything in '/etc/ld.so.preload'
# - LD_LIBRARY_PATH env variable (can be set in the shell)
# - DT_RUNPATH or DT_RPATH specified in the binary file (both can be modified w/patchelf)
# - system-wide configuration -- /etc/ld.so.conf
# - /lib/ and /usr/lib

## The interpreter LOADS the libraries
# - these libraries can depend on other libraries causing other libraries to be loaded
# - relocations updated

## setting the LD_PRELOAD env variable ##
# Example...
# - gcc -shared -o name.so program.c
# - LD_PRELOAD=name.so (LD_PRELOAD is loaded into process)
# - ./calling-program (LD_PRELOAD is called in the calling program because it is loaded into it)
