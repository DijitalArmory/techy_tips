## Processes terminate by one of two ways
# - receiving an unhandled signal
# - calling the 'exit()' system call --> int exit(int status);


### 
# All processes must be "REAPED"
# - after termination, they remain in a 'zombie' state until they are 'wait()ed' on their parent.
# - when this happens, their exit code will be returned to the parent, and the process will be freed. 
# - if the parent dies without 'wait90ing' on them, they are re-parented to PID 1 and will stay there until they are cleaned up.
