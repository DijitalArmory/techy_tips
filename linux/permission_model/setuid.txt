### One way to elevate privileges to root is to run a setuid binary
# SUID is a bit in the linux permission model 

# SUID executes program with the eUID file owner rather than the parent process
# SGID executes a program with the eGID of the file owner rather than the parent process

## Common examples of SUID are 'sudo', 'su', 'newgrp'.


# NOTE:
## There are 3 different types of user and group IDs...
# - Effective(eUID, eGID) -- the UID/GID used for most acess checks
# - Real (UID, GID) -- the "real"/actual UID/GID of the process owner (used for things such as signal checks) 
# Saved -- a UID/GID that your process could switch it's eUID/eGID to. Used for temporarily dropping privliges

### Set the setuid bit ###
# command='chmod u+s <program_name>' <--- sets the permissions to the file's owner for any user running it
