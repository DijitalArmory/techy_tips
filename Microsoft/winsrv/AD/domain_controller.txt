# Here are the high-level steps involved in setting up Active Directory (AD) for an enterprise company:
# - Planning and design: Determine the requirements and design a plan for your AD environment, including the number of domains, forests, and organizational units (OUs) needed.
# - Installing the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role: You can install AD DS on a server running Windows Server operating system.
# - Creating a forest and domain: Create the first domain in your AD environment, which will also create the forest.
# - Creating organizational units: Organize the objects in your AD environment by creating OUs and nesting them in a hierarchical structure.
# - Creating user accounts: Create user accounts for each person who needs access to the network resources.
# - Creating groups: Create groups to manage user accounts more efficiently and apply Group Policy settings to a large number of users.
# - Setting up Group Policy: Configure Group Policy objects (GPOs) to apply settings to users and computers in your AD environment.
# - Setting up and configuring access to network resources: Configure file and print servers, web servers, email servers, and other network resources and set permissions to control access.
# - Adding and configuring additional domain controllers: If necessary, add additional domain controllers to provide redundancy and improve performance.
# - Monitoring and maintaining AD: Regularly monitor the performance and status of AD and make any necessary changes to ensure its continued operation.
